          " It has a more static gameplay design, with social interactions as the main focus of the action. Making jokes and interesting conversations between characters is what it is all about, with additional games available on the side. It goes without saying that making guides about how to make a popular video, trendy Gacha Life characters, or a cool story would be missing the point, as that part is best left to the players’ imagination. However, the community is interested in certain gameplay mechanics and features. We will try and answer the most commonly asked questions.  Players can create characters with an incredibly wide array of customizations, and we’re talking wide, possibly the largest character customization pool in mobile gaming. Secondly, they can create their own stories for these characters, with chat bubbles, scenes, and everything a movie maker, director, producer, and writer would do. And, lastly, they can watch it unfold the way they meant it and share it with the community via the web. Not, this is where it all went wrong, with the explicit themes dominating the content created. Some videos have several millions of views"

With the familiar animation style, minimalistic animations, and colorful chibi-style characters, this game offers everything a player might need to do what it is intended, which is to create multimedia content within the limits of its asset list, and it is a wide list for sure"

This is where you’ll find the monetization trap, for the prestigious cosmetics are widely spread across the community, and making a trendy video would presumably rely on using these premium features. However, the player can access all of the game’s features without paying a single dime, and if you are not into fashion trends and competing with in-game cosmetics, you will be ok"

          "Given the nature of the context in which kids who play game mostly go for, this game has caused mass controversy and hysteria on the web. If you want a quick look at what we mean by this, just type in Gacha Life on YouTube or Google and see the titles of the most viewed videos. They will mostly be referring to some adult theme, LGBT, and other 18+ content, often too weird and too far gone that it could produce a negative effect, so be advised. Oddly enough, it is rated PEGI 3, but most other parental advisory sites rate it 9+ or even higher. It is mostly because the community is heavily soaked with content including adult themes and relationship materials between characters, but also because the game offers loads of in-game purchases and ads which exploit underage users with access to a credit card"

Firstly, with so many similar titles developed by Lunime before, they’ve honed their skill and this game has the perfect delivery. This is one of the best gaming apps of its kind in the market, no two words about it, and it is not the developers’ fault that the community is using it to create mostly explicit content. However, due to the nature of the explicitness and some often disturbing themes, a parental advisory is strongly advised"

Gacha Life characters, movies, pictures, YouTube videos, cute animations, drawings, and various other publications have millions of views and are being made by children. Yes, by that we mean actual children, like elementary school age. It is not thus surprising that, given their unsupervised access to the web, that the topics of these Gacha ideas are mostly in the naughty section, and we mean adult material. Flooded with LGBT and liberal 18+ ideas, which are transcribed onto Gacha Life Characters, this game has already grown into parental concern"

It is aimed at promoting creativity and creating an environment in which younger audiences can sort of creating their games or animations. In theory, this does sound good and beneficial, if not for the terribly wrong turn to the explicit content"
