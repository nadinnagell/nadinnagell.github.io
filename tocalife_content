          "My kids (like many kids of other GeekDads and GeekMoms) have been fans of Toca Boca apps for some time now, and we got a chance to try out some of latest Toca Life apps, as well as Toca Lab: Plants. Here is a quick look at each of the apps, and why we like them!\nIn case you re not familiar with Toca Boca, their apps available for iOS and Android are all about digital play. Most of them are more like toys than games, because you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a specific end goal. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re more about exploration and make-believe, so most of them are not like what you usually think of as Ã¢â‚¬Å“videogames.The Toca Life apps are a great example of that.\nToca Boca provided me with download codes for Toca Life: Pets, Toca Life: Vacation, Toca Life: Hospital, and Toca Labs: Plants. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s have a look"

          "The sign at the bottom of the screen brings up a sidewalk at the bottom with all of the characters available in that world, so that you can drag and drop them into your scene even if they re currently in another location. It s pretty remarkable all of the various ways you can interact with everything: there are clothes and accessories so that you can dress up the people just by dragging them onto the character. The clothes they were wearing before will turn into a neatly folded pile, ready to be put away. There are doors and cabinets to open and shut, faucets turn on and off with a tap, and nearly every object you see on the screen can be picked up, placed in a characters hand to hold, or sometimes even eaten by the characters"
